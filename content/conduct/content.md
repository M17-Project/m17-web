### Our Community

Members of the M17 community are **open, considerate, and respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

* **Being open.** Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on standards and specifications, patches, problems, or otherwise.
* **Acknowledging time and effort.** We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the M17 community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.
* **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.** We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
* **Showing empathy towards other community members.** We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.
* **Being considerate.** Members of the community are considerate of their peers.
* **Being respectful.** We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.
* **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language.** We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

### Our Standards
Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The M17 community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, sex, sexual orientation, disability, mental and/or physical illnesses, physical appearance, political views, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, socio-economic status, or other differences.

Be excellent to each other.

### Inappropriate Behavior
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Harassment of any participants in any form
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Logging or taking screenshots of online activity for harassment purposes
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Violent threats or language directed against another person
* Incitement of violence or harassment towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Creating additional online accounts in order to harass another person or circumvent a ban
* Sexual language and imagery in online communities or in any conference venue, including talks
* Insults, put downs, or jokes that are based upon stereotypes, that are exclusionary, or that hold others up for ridicule.
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Unwelcome physical contact, including simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Sustained disruption of online community discussions, in-person presentations, or other in-person events
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds
* Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all people involved with the M17 Project, in all spaces that M17 project members control, including but not limited to: 

* M17 forums
* M17 IRC, Discord, Matrix or other chat rooms
* M17 mailing lists, and email communications
* Reflectors owned by the M17 Project
* M17 Twitter page (@m17_project) and other M17 social media pages
* M17 Project Youtube or other media streams, including related chat or comments
* M17 Github or other software forges
* Other, as-yet unknown mediums for interpersonal interaction

In short, all interactions within the M17 Project realm of influence are expected to be consistent with this CoC, between all people.

### Consequences

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the M17 community core development team may take any action they deem appropriate, from warnings up to permanent bans and blocks of the offender from all M17 platforms.

### Contact Information

If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the M17 working group as soon as possible by emailing contact@m17.link

### Discussion Guidelines

When in doubt, the [excellent ARRL guide for Amateur Radio operations may be useful](http://www.arrl.org/files/file/DXCC/Eth-operating-EN-ARRL-CORR-JAN-2011.pdf).
(If in conflict with the M17 CoC here, the M17 CoC prevails.)

### Attributions

This Code of Conduct was forked from the [Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/), which is in turn based on language from many others. 

Thank you all!
