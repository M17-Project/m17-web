The M17 Working group have been working on the project for over a year now, and while we have made substantial progress, we are looking for some help. Specifically, we are looking for people with the following skills:

* C programming (Raspberry Pi, STM32, PC)
* PCB routing (preferably KiCAD)
* Familiarity with 3D printing, CAD/CAM
* Soldering, prototyping
* Open mind â€“ concept testing

If you have any interest in working with us on this project, you can contact the M17 Working Group via email using the Contact Us link at the top, or joining us on IRC or Matrix!
