Broadly, the M17 Project is an adventure in Amateur Radio, with an aim to provide an option to those in the community away from commercially available digital radio modes, which have become encumbered by proprietary hardware, software, and protocols.

The desire of the M17 Project is to provide:

* an Open-Source community
* freely available and modifiable digital radio protocol
* open hardware designs

We welcome everyone to join us in our little adventure, you don't have to be an Amateur radio operator. If you are a hacker, a maker, a DIY-er, radio enthusiast, or even just someone with the desire to learn something... come join us!

**We would love to have you!**
